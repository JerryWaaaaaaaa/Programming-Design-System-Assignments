# Programming-Design-System-Assignments

## About
These are the assignments that I've done for the class called Programming Design System, taught by [Rune Madson](https://github.com/runemadsen) at NYU Shanghai.

The class teaches us how to take advantage of the computational power to add more efficiency and possibilities to a 
design project. I selected some small projects related to topics such as poster design, type design, and pattern design.

## Assignments
### Generative Poster
This is a poster design for the movie *Martian*. Every time the sketch is run, it will generate a new poster for the movie with a slightly different look from the others. 
### Generative Alphabet
This is a type design project that we are asked to do by utilizing the Grid System. I made an pixelized look alphabet, with each 
letter formed by a 4*4 grid. The sizes of each row and column as well as the color can be changed based on the users' preference.
### Generative Metro Ticket
This is a ticket design project. I focused on making the three-day ticket for the Shanghai Metro. As it is the ticket type that 
most tourists will buy, I want to embed the landmarks and the well-known stations in the ticket design, making the ticket function
as a tour guide as well.
### Generative Fine Art
This is a redo of Yayoi Kusama's famous pumpkin piece. 
### Generative Pattern
This is a project that I took advantage of the power of code to test with some patterns for my project
